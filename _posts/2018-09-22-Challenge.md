title: 100 day challenge
excerpt: Wanting to be a good team player, I accept the blank sheet and proudly proclaim "I will do 100 days of creative writing"...

My son has completed a 100 day challenge several times with his Suzuki violin class.  Like many activies, repetition and a disciplined commitment are the cornerstone of aquiring new skills.  Violin is no different in this regard.  As an example, I've included the preface from Suzuki Violin Book 3.  I truly believe that Dr. Suzuki would have been fast friends with Dr. Carol Dweck (Growth Mindset researcher).

At the conclusion of today's group lesson one of the other students offered my son a new, blank 100 day challenge sheet.  He tentatively takes it from her because he knows how hard it is to complete. For some reason, she then offers both my wife and me a blank sheet.  Without skipping a beat my wife takes one to track her daily guitar practice.  

Wanting to be a good team player and support my family, I accept the blank sheet and proudly proclaim "I will do 100 days of creative writing". <-- I have no idea where this came from.

As we walked out the door my wife says "Are you going to write short stories, haikus, and essays?"  I responded that I plan to work on blog posts everyday.  In the spirit of transparency, I'm not a blogger.  In fact, I can count on one hand how many blog posts I've written.  

So...this is day 1 of a new habit. 

A have a few ideas for upcoming posts including:

1. Podcast series I love
2. Leadership, coaching, continous improvement
3. Possibly some Chili Dog reviews

As mentioned, I see so many parallels between the work many of us are doing to lead transformations and the writings of Dr. Shinichi Suzuki from 1951.  

## **SUZUKI PREFACE**
    
TL;DR 
* Ability is something that develops only after one has worked diligently
* Study Daily without exception
* Not to rush ahead, but to dedicate oneself to attaining excellent tone
* Practice pieces already learned so as to continually improve oneâ€™s performance
