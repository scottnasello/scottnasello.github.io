title: ChatOps ... A Love Story
excerpt: ChatOps was so instrumental to our progress that we even had a birthday part for our ChatBot (RYU)

If you couldn't tell from the title, I am a complete Homer when it comes to ChatOps and I've most likely lost all objectivity.  ChatOps has had a profound impact on my teams of Infrastructure Engineers as well as sister teams that went on a journey with us.

ChatOps can be so much more than the technical details.  

For us it has been fundamentally about collaboration, people and teaching our organization to learn.  At it's best it has been a pure manifestation of **C.A.L.M.S (Culture, Automation, Lean, Metrics, Sharing)**. 

Our DevOps journey was positively impacted by ChatOps.  In fact, ChatOps was often a tireless change agent helping new members understand how to work while also helping our veterans to learn to contribute in new ways. In fact, ChatOps was so instrumental to our progress that we even had a birthday party for our ChatBot (RYU).

One of my very favorite stories during this time occurred when we had a team building at top golf...unfortunately, we also had a storage migration that was in progress.  Rather than miss the event this engineer created ChatOps scripts to control the migration as well as monitor the progress.

## Onboarding
ChatOps absolutely shines in helping new members get up to speed.  They can observe how we interact and become familiar with internal customers, peers, and services within the organization.

We were super inspired by the [Etsy day 1 program](https://codeascraft.com/2012/03/13/making-it-virtually-easy-to-deploy-on-day-one/) where new team members deploy on their first day.  Similarly, our new engineers commit on day 1 to our production ChatOps environment. The great thing about having new hires deploy day 1 is that we reinforce how excited we are to have them join and how much confidence we have in the safety of our processes.  Can you imagine the conversation at dinner for our new engineer and their family? 

Because ChatOps is a shared console, pairing can be used to train or coach team members. Pairing sessions perfectly lend themselves to a crawl/walk/run approach ... think of it as **training wheels** for your new hires.

To make onboarding easier, we developed a process that autogenerates coffee scripts from PowerShell at git commit using our **PowerShell Wrapper** process.  New members can focus on the mechanics of git, branching, and,check-in using a simple one liner.  We have found this to help team members come up to speed quicker as it abstracts complexity.  When team members require more features or control they can move to working with coffee scripts.  In fact, many engineers will start this process by editing the system generated coffee script.

ChatOps is gentle (and self contained) **introduction** to our technology stack of Git, GitLab CI, PowerShell, Hubot, and CHEF.  While working with their first scripts we can explain how the sausage is being made so they will have a conceptual model for how we are implementing CI/CD, DevOps, Pull Requests.

## Finding friction
If our experience is represenative, you should reasonably expect to encounter numerous examples of friction during your transformation.  At the time we were working in cross functional infrastructure squads, asking individuals to go outside of their traditional areas of focus.  In this case ChatOps is both an identifier of friction and a means to address the friction.  Afer you understand your sources of friction you can do something about it.

* **Permissions** - Over many years our engineers built systems to operate themselves.  As you might imagine, elevated permissions were required to operate these systems.  What do you think happened when we started working as cross functional squads?  You got it, roadblock after roadblock.  ChatOps can help to alleviate these islands of permissions walls.

* **Dependencies** - In the Linux world we have powerful package management systems (rpm, apt, yum).  As a *mostly* Windows shop we could use [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/) to manage packages, yet we'd still find ourselves fighting issues.  An example may be grabbing a PowerShell script from version control and then having to install many modules to be able to run it. As we moved into CHEF it was common to see our leads having to troubleshoot Ruby, Gems, PowerShell Modules, PS Gallery issues, etc. Moving to artifactory and ChatOps gave us stability we could not have achieved otherwise.

* **Training & Experience** - How do newer members of the team gain the training and experience they need to operate within the team?  It can be incredibly frustrating for members not to feel like they are full fledged members of the team.  ChatOps can help reduce this type of friction by pairing as well as observing how other members work with various systems.

* **Context** - How many times have you been added to a disjointed email thread? ChatOps minimizes poor context situations because we typically see: Stimulus - Discussion - Action - Outcome - Discussion. Others in channel receive indirect training because they can see how another engineer has worked a given issue.

* **Timezone & Language** - Prior to chatops we‚Äôd see routine cross time-zone requests take multiple days to satisfy. Not only has ChatOps encouraged more decentralized execution with much more responsive outcomes.  I believe most of this is because teams have been empowered to solve issues in real time, which leads to happier stakeholders.

* **Organization structure** - When requests go througth the proper channels/esclations we experience friction and normally waits/waste. ChatOps can enable more productive cross-team interactions including new patterns of collaboration that don't need to be initiated by management.  In effect, the organization is developing organic networks that can lubricate our other activities.

* **Tribal Knowledge** - Prior to ChatOps we had scripts in email accounts, on hard drives, sometimes in version control but often disconnected from any context of why they exist.  As engineers started to move scripts to the shared Chat environment others would ask questions about how to use the scripts (which led to more documentation).  As we gained more users of Chat commands would be improved.  

## Supporting the learning organization

As we accelerated our ChatOps practice, it has encouraged more scripts to be created and shared.  At this point we have well over 500 scripts spanning all major technologies (Active Directory, vmware, EMC, Teradata, Commvault, SAP, SQL, Carbon Black, etc.). As mentioned, a key unlock for us was the wrapper process for PowerShell scripts.  Evenually members of other organizations asked us to create a **Python wrapper** as well.  Our practice has made it safe for engineers to learn, apply, and improve their coding practices.  

## Examples of ChatOps

### NOC empowerment
I love these 3 examples as they provide a comprehensive view of operations and enable even the newest of team members to gain an understanding of current status and contribute to our vision of more transparency, greater cross-training, and decentralized execution.  I also love that they are some of our newest scripts and the engineers who wrote them were looking to solve a problem.

### Jenkins Menu
This example was created by an engineer to enable adhoc jenkins jobs, especially by stakeholders who didn't have access to Jenkins.

### Cloud Activities

This example ensures that every new repository is created in a consistent manner.  If new requirements emerge, new instances will be created without having to re-train users.

### Retail Operations
Here's an example of creating a new retail store.  With this scripting we get a high degree of standardization/repeatability.

### Software Packaging
This example was created by a Tier 2 admin in Asia who wanted to manage his application packaging process better.  Once you have an extensible platform, if you get out of the way your teams will do great things.

### CHEF cookbook promotion
As we have matured our ChatOps practices our engineers have automated the things that cause them the greatest pain (like having to cart around a laptop).  This is an example of being able to promote chef cookbooks through our test environments.
