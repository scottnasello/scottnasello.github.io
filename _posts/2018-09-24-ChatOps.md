title: ChatOps ... A Love Story
excerpt: ChatOps was so instrumental to our progress that we even had a birthday part for our ChatBot (RYU)
---

ChatOps is so much more than the technical details.  For us it has been fundamentally about collaboration and people.  At it's best it has been a pure manifestation of **C.A.L.M.S (Culture, Automation, Lean, Metrics, Sharing)**. Our DevOps journey was positively impacted by ChatOps.  In fact, ChatOps was often a tireless change agent helping new members how to work while also showing our veterans how to contribute. In fact, ChatOps was so instrumental to our progress that we even had a birthday part for our ChatBot (RYU)

One of my very favorite stories during this time occurred when we had a team building at top golf...unfortunately, we also had a storage migration that was in progress.  Rather than miss the event this engineer created scripts we could **ALL** use to control the migration as well as monitor the progress.

## Onboarding
ChatOps absolutely shines in helping new members get up to speed.  They can observe how we interact and become familiar with internal customers, peers, and services within the organization.

We were super inspired by the [Etsy day 1 program](https://codeascraft.com/2012/03/13/making-it-virtually-easy-to-deploy-on-day-one/) where their new engineers must deploy on their first day.  Similarly, our new engineers commit on day 1 to our production ChatOps environment.  The great thing about having new hires deploy day 1 is that we reinforce how excited we are to have them join and they are immediately contributing.  Can you imagine the conversation at dinner for our new engineer and their family?  What did you do today?  I deployed to production!

Because ChatOps is a shared console, pairing can be used to train or coach team members. Pairing sessions perfectly lend themselves to a crawl/walk/run approach ... think of it as training wheels for your new hires.

To make onboarding easier, we developed a process that autogenerates coffee scripts by wrapping powershell at git commit.  This helps team members come up to speed quicker as it abstracts complexity.  Engineers move on to editing coffee scripts when they need more features or control.  In fact, many engineers will start by editing the system generated coffee script.

ChatOps is gentle (and self contained) introduction to our technology stack of Git, GitLab CI, Hubot, and CHEF.  As they commit their first script we can explain how CI/CD, DevOps, and other concepts work.

## Finding friction
ChatOps helps identify sources of friction (so you can do something about it).  Before ChatOps it was common to see our leads having to troubleshoot Ruby, Gems, PowerShell Modules, PS Gallery issues, etc.  Moving to artifactory and ChatOps gave us stability we could not have achieved.

How many times have you been added to a disjointed email thread? ChatOps minimizes **poor context** situations because the stimulus is typically preceding the command. Others in channel receive indirect training because they can see how another engineer has worked an issue.

Prior to chatops we‚Äôd see routine cross time-zone requests take multiple days to satisfy. ChatOps has encouraged more **decentralized execution** with much more responsive outcomes... Teams are more engaged and empowered to solve issues in real time, which leads to happier stakeholders

**Organization structure** can be an impediment when requests must go through certain channels or escalations. ChatOps can enable more productive cross-team interactions including new patterns of collaboration that don't need to be initiated by management.  In effect, the organization is developing organic networks that can lubricate our other activities.

## Supporting the learning organization

As we accelerated our ChatOps practice, it has encouraged more scripts to be created and shared.  At this point we have well over 500 scripts spanning all major technologies (EMC, Teradata, Commvault, SAP, etc.). As mentioned, a key unlock for us was the wrapper process for PowerShell scripts.  Evenually members of other organizations asked us to create a Python wrapper as well.  In essence our practice has made it safe for engineers to learn, apply, and improve their coding practices.
