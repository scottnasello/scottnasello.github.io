title: ChatOps ... A Love Story
excerpt:

ChatOps can be so much more than the technical details.  For us it’s fundamentally about collaboration and people. A couple years ago we had a team building at top golf...unfortunately, we also had a storage migration that was in progress.  Rather than miss the event this engineer created scripts we could **ALL** use to control the migration as well as monitor the progress.

## Onboarding
ChatOps absolutely shines in helping new members get up to speed.  They can observe how we interact and become familiar with internal customers, peers, and services within the organization.

We ripped off the **Etsy** day 1 program.  All new engineers commit on day 1 to our production ChatOps environment.  The great thing about having new hires deploy day 1 is that we reinforce how excited we are to have them join and they are immediately contributing.  Can you imagine the conversation at dinner for our new engineer and their family?  What did you do today?  I deployed to production!

Because ChatOps is a shared console, pairing can be used to train or coach team members. Pairing session perfectly lend themselves to 
a crawl/walk/run approach ... think of it as training wheels for your new hires.

To make onboarding easier, we developed a process that autogenerates coffee scripts by wrapping powershell at git commit.  This helps team members come up to speed quicker as it abstracts complexity.  Engineers move on to editing coffee scripts when they need more features or control.  In fact, many engineers will start by editing the system generated coffee script.

ChatOps is gentle (and self contained) introduction to our technology stack of Git, GitLab CI, Hubot, and CHEF.  As they commit their first script we can explain how CI/CD, DevOps, and other concepts work.

## Finding friction
ChatOps helps identify sources of friction (so you can do something about it).  Before ChatOps it was common to see our leads having to troubleshoot Ruby, Gems, PowerShell Modules, PS Gallery issues, etc.  Moving to artifactory and ChatOps gave us stability we could not have achieved.

How many times have you been added to a disjointed email thread? ChatOps minimizes poor context situations because the stimulus is typically preceding the command. Others in channel receive indirect training due to the

Prior to chatops we’d see routine cross time-zone requests take a day or more to satisfy. ChatOps has encouraged more 
decentralized execution with much more responsive outcomes... Teams are more engaged and empowered 

Organization structure can be an impediment when requests must go through 
certain channels or escalations. ChatOps can enable more productive cross-team interactions including new patterns of collaboration 

As we accelerated our ChatOps practice, it has encouraged more scripts to 
be created and shared. Recently, we’ve had scripts contributed spanning many technologies such as: EMC, Teradata, Commvault, SAP. 
Every script increases organizational knowledge 

As we heard in the gitlab postmortem yesterday, transparency builds empathy, context, and 
understanding. ChatOps can reduce isolated shell scripting. In fact, since we can all see what others are working on, we can help in a 
variety of ways
