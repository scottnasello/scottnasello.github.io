excerpt: "It's John Allspaw's fault"

Did you know it only takes ____ days in a row to create a new habit? The corollary is it only takes a few days to forget a habit, perhaps forever. I'll provide many examples of not reaching goals in this post.

## Right Shoe, Left Shoe Challenge

Which shoe do you put on first in the morning?  Do you even know?  I sometimes ask an engineer about which shoe they put on as an exercise in mindfulness and habit breaking/habit forming.  A simple exercise we can all do is to vary which shoe we put on first.  Another variation might be to change which of your teeth you start your brushing with.

## P60X

Yes I know there it is really called P90X...I had been diligently completing the routines daily (as one does) but a funny thing happened...I had to travel and I skipped a few days and before you knew it, I had quit a month before the finish line (hence P60X).  We are going to see this pattern again later in this post.

In my defense I wasn't set up for success.  For whatever reason my wife and I decided to do it after work & after dinner.  In some cases we started at 8:30 or 9:00.   Frankly, I'm surprised we made it as far as we did because who has energy for a bunch of nonsense right before bed?

## Flow Free

[flow free](https://www.bigduckgames.com/flowfree) is an excellent diversion, or in my case an obsession. Each puzzle can take 15-60 seconds, although some puzzles have taken 10 minutes or more.  Not only does the game have thousands of puzzles, but it also has a daily challenge mode.  After completing all the puzzle packs, I keep coming back to the daily puzzles.  At this point I'm at 821 days in a row and it's all John Allspaw's fault.  The tweet below started the longest continuous daily habit I've ever had.

For the first 200 days or so I was worried that I wouldn't be able to solve a puzzle.  As I completed more puzzles and gained confidence I **know** I can solve any puzzle, but now I have a different problem...what if I forget to do my daily puzzles?  As crazy as this sounds it has nearly happened a few times including twice at the same crazy karoke bar in San Francisco.  In fact one time I noticed about 10 minutes before midnight and I start scrambling to do the puzzles (while also casually entertaining changing the time on my phone).  

Another near miss happened when I dropped my car off for an overnight service.  Later that night I'm looking for my phone and realize I left it in the center console of my car and the mechanics have left for the day.  All of a sudden I'm back in my dark place thinking of how I can possibly keep the streak alive.  Luckily this particular game is part of the game center on iOS and I was able to complete my puzzles on an iPad.

The funny thing is I don't have a consistent time that I do the puzzles.  After 2 years of this habit you'd think I would settled on a time of day to do them...nope, I'm living a bit dangerously.

## Essentialism

[Essentialism](https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382) is an incredible book and I'd highly recommend you checking it out. This book was the first selection in a shortish lived remote book club.  (We also read: Turn the Ship Around, The Manager's Path, High Velocity Edge, and Hit Refresh).  As I sometimes do I was super inspired by the ideas and I committed to some pretty crazy goals.

All I can say is I'm **very** human.  

## Waking up routines

What do you do when you first wake up?  It is incredibly easy to get into a rut by checking email, social media, or possibly slack channels from the night before.  I've done all of the above but I've also had intermittent periods of more virtuous habits.  

At one point I started out my day by doing push ups right next to the bed. As my memory serves me I stayed in the habit for about three months. Out of boredom I started trying out different types of pushups such as diamonds, wide arms, handstands, etc.  As was the case with P90X I missed a few days and before I knew it I stopped the push ups altogether.

I enjoyed the daily pushups.  As another countermeasure to aging, I need to figure out some process that doesn't go off the rails if I miss a day or two.  I wonder what it is about the consecutive days/streak that makes it more compelling?
