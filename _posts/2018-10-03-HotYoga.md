# 5 Reasons I love Hot Yoga
## I owe my DevOps career to Hot Yoga

Many of us in the DevOps community have a [Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/1942788290?keywords=phoenix+project&qid=1538282916&sr=8-1&ref=sr_1_1) story. In my case, I was lucky enough to catch [Gene Kim](@RealGeneKim) discussing many of the concepts from the book such as the [three ways](https://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/) and I felt thunderstruck by the application of Theory of Constraints and many of Deming's ideas to IT.  These ideas made a ton of sense to me because earlier in my career I had spent a number of years designing, implementing, and sometimes operating large scale Supply Chain Planning Systems.  Occasionally this also meant leading manufacturing transformations (Toyota Production System, Lean, Just In Time, Kanban, etc.). 

I was leading our software development teams (.NET, java, ABAP, SQL, EDI, BizTalk, Informatica) and we had started exploring some areas to apply DevOps...In those days you didn't hear about very much DevOps innovation in enterprises let alone in enterprises focused on the Microsoft stack or N Tier Packaged (COTS) Software.      

**I thought you were writing about Yoga!** Around 2014 I was doing a lot of [hot yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikram_Yoga) and during [Shavasana (aka Corpse Pose)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavasana) I was reflecting on what I really wanted to be when I grew up.  Although I enjoyed most things in the IT leadership realm, I was getting a bit restless and I really missed being a part of an active business transformation. Luckily I had opportunity to lead the Platforms & Systems Engineering teams which would be well outside my background but would be a great place to focus on building a learning organization focused on continuous improvement.  I credit Hot Yoga with putting me into the frame of mind to take on this new challenge.  Without hot yoga I likely wouldn't have felt confident in taking the plunge.

## #GrowthMindset

As DevOps practioners we often talk about going outside of a comfort zones by challenging ourselves with different ways of working, new technologies, or taking risks.  These ideas have been popularized by Dr. Carol Dweck's [mindset research](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en) in which describes both a fixed mindset and a growth mindset.  Individuals with a [growth mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset#Fixed_and_growth) don't mind or fear failure as much because they realize their performance can be improved and learning comes from failure.  Conversely, individual with a fixed mindset dread failure because it is a negative statement on their basic abilities. 

Hot Yoga is self-contained opportunity to push myself outside my comfort zone  in physical way versus IT work.  The more I push myself, the greater the payoff.  I'm currently trying to perfect my side crow and headstands.  Frequently I don't want to get out of bed for the 6 AM yoga class (reminds me too much of my time in the Army?) but **I am always glad that I made the effort.**

 I often find this practice seeping into my professional activities by encouraging me to go outside my comfort zone.  As I role model #GrowthMindset I do notice colleagues going outside their comfort zones as well.
