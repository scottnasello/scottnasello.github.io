# Systems Thinking

In this blog post we'll briefly introduce the reader to systems thinking and then increase intuition by way of examples.

## Systems Thinking
* A system is a set of elements that are interconnected to achieve a purpose.  These interconnections mostly operate through the flow of information.  
* Systems tend to create their own behaviors.  Although the system may respond to some external stimulation, the system's response will be the influenced by buffers, constraints, and sub-system's behaviors.  As we'd imagine the same external stimulii will not create the same effects in different systems.  In fact, the same stimulii may not even create the same outcomes in the same system across a range of conditions such as time, volume, etc.
  
## The purpose of a system
* The purpose of a system is not necessarily the stated goal or even the system's metrics...The best way to determine the purpose of the system is to watch it for a while to see how the system behaves.  
  
## Characteristics of Systems
* Feedback Loops
* Reliability, Self-Organization, Hierarchy
  * Reliability
  * Self-Organization
  * Hierarchy

## There is no perfect perspective
* A systems thinking perspective generally will be a "tops down" perspective, but all points of view matter.  In the words of the author, "You can see some things through the lens of the human eye, other things through the lens of a microscope, others through the lens of a telescope, and still others through the lens of systems theory. Everything seen through each kind of lens is actually there."
