## Intro

During a recent meeting I was sharing the typical age of workarounds we use to support digital order flow with an audience of senior leaders.  I wanted to bring visibility to the issue and build enthusiasm to eliminate these longstanding workarounds.  Unfortunately, the discussion went sideways into a discussion about organizational staffing levels.  Not only wasn't I successful in conveying why workarounds are so damaging, I also didn't do a great job of introducing systems thinking to these leaders.  This blog post is my "do-over" for why systems thinking matters and how it can help to make you a better engineer or leader.

## 10 Reasons to learn about systems thinking
1) Systems Thinking can be seen in many other movements such as: OKRs, Chaos Engineering, DevOps, Theory of Constraints, and Just culture
   * ***Objectives and key results (OKR)*** is a goal-setting framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.  Because Systems Thinking is concerned with the outcomes and behaviors of systems via the pursuit of goals and purposes, Systems thinking may be a powerful tool in your toolbox to help you establish and achieve your OKRs.
   * ***Chaos Engineering*** acknowleges that our systems are complex and ever-changing and we likely don't really know how these systems will behave under a variety of circumstances. With chaos engineering we can build experiments to gain insights into how our systems behave as well as create confidence that our systems can withstand unexpected conditions.  Netflix made chaos engineering famous via their [simian army](https://netflixtechblog.com/the-netflix-simian-army-16e57fbab116). 
   * ***DevOps*** has many definitions and many of strong opinions. For the purposes of this post we'll focus on the [three ways of DevOps](https://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/) popularlized by Gene Kim in the Phoenix Project.   
        > The First Way emphasizes the performance of the entire system, as opposed to the performance of a specific silo of work or department â€” this as can be as large a division (e.g., Development or IT Operations) or as small as an individual contributor (e.g., a developer, system administrator).

        > The Second Way is about creating the right to left feedback loops. The goal of almost any process improvement initiative is to shorten and amplify feedback loops so necessary corrections can be continually made.

        > The Third Way is about creating a culture that fosters two things: continual experimentation, taking risks and learning from failure; and understanding that repetition and practice is the prerequisite to mastery.
   * Theory of Constraints
   * Just culture 
2) Misbehaving systems are all around us
3) Understanding the role of hiearchies versus the overall system
4) Nearly all system issues can be explained by one or more "archetypes"
5) Systems Thinking can help engineers and leaders understand and anticipate system design issues
6) Working with complex systems
7) Understanding why workarounds suboptimize systems in the long run
