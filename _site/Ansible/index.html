  <h1>Using configuration management at home</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>During my wife’s recent trip to the east coast I decided I would take my circa 2015 macbook and fully automate it and manage it with a configuration management software.  You  might want to know what kind of sick puppy would do this intentionally <strong>{me}</strong>.  Here was my thinking:</p>
<ol>
  <li>As a manager, I don’t get to do as much hands on work as I’d like</li>
  <li>I’m frustrated by the config drift I have at home…everything is a snowflake</li>
  <li>I wanted to learn <a href="https://learn.chef.io">CHEF</a> <strong>more on that later</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Why CHEF? I wanted to use the same technology we use at work. Unfortunately, I did not find many <em>current</em> examples of folks using chef to manage their own personal machines. I did experiment with the excellent examples by <a href="https://github.com/jtimberman/workstation-chef-repo">jtimberman</a> and <a href="https://github.com/echohack/chef_desktop">echohack</a>, but in the case of Joshua’s repo, it hasn’t changed in about 5 years and echohack’s in a MVP.</p>

<p>In the end, I found a ton of folks using Ansible for their daily drivers.  Since I’m relatively proficient with CHEF on Windows, I ventured into the unknown with Ansible/Mac <strong>(#GrowthMindset)</strong>.  I might even make some new friends with our Networking team due to the python orientation of Ansible.</p>

<p>I started out with <a href="https://blog.vandenbrand.org/2016/01/04/how-to-automate-your-mac-os-x-setup-with-ansible/">Richard van den Brand’s blog post</a> and particularly liked the simplicity and manipulation of OS X features such as the dock.  Ultimately I forked &amp; implemented <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook">Jeff Geerling’s repo</a> as I preferred his organization and extendability.  With Jeff’s implementation you will really only need to modify the default.config.yml file.  I added a macbuild.sh to bootstrap my process.  This would enable me to manage the entire process even before homebrew/git were set up.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>bash &lt;<span class="o">(</span>curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottnasello/mac-dev-playbook/master/macbuild.sh<span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The only pain point I never quite figured out was installing xcode…Although several folks provide methods to silently install, it never seemed to work for me on Sierra (10.12.5).</p>

<p>I invested about 12 hours into this process and now my mac <strong>(this mac)</strong> is fully managed via my github repo and ansible.  Here’s a short video of the bootstrapping process (IRL: 15 minutes, condensed to 15 seconds)</p>
