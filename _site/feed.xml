You  might want to know what kind of sick puppy would do this intentionally &lt;strong&gt;{me}&lt;/strong&gt;.  Here was my thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a manager, I don’t get to do as much hands on work as I’d like&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m frustrated by the config drift I have at home…everything is a snowflake&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wanted to learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.chef.io&quot;&gt;CHEF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;more on that later&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why CHEF? I wanted to use the same technology we use at work. Unfortunately, I did not find many &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; examples of folks using chef to manage their own personal machines. I did experiment with the excellent examples by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jtimberman/workstation-chef-repo&quot;&gt;jtimberman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/echohack/chef_desktop&quot;&gt;echohack&lt;/a&gt;, but in the case of Joshua’s repo, it hasn’t changed in about 5 years and echohack’s in a MVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I found a ton of folks using Ansible for their daily drivers.  Since I’m relatively proficient with CHEF on Windows, I ventured into the unknown with Ansible/Mac &lt;strong&gt;(#GrowthMindset)&lt;/strong&gt;.  I might even make some new friends with our Networking team due to the python orientation of Ansible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.vandenbrand.org/2016/01/04/how-to-automate-your-mac-os-x-setup-with-ansible/&quot;&gt;Richard van den Brand’s blog post&lt;/a&gt; and particularly liked the simplicity and manipulation of OS X features such as the dock.  Ultimately I forked &amp;amp; implemented &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook&quot;&gt;Jeff Geerling’s repo&lt;/a&gt; as I preferred his organization and extendability.  With Jeff’s implementation you will really only need to modify the default.config.yml file.  I added a macbuild.sh to bootstrap my process.  This would enable me to manage the entire process even before homebrew/git were set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bash &amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottnasello/mac-dev-playbook/master/macbuild.sh&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only pain point I never quite figured out was installing xcode…Although several folks provide methods to silently install, it never seemed to work for me on Sierra (10.12.5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I invested about 12 hours into this process and now my mac &lt;strong&gt;(this mac)&lt;/strong&gt; is fully managed via my github repo and ansible.  Here’s a short video of the bootstrapping process (IRL: 15 minutes, condensed to 15 seconds)&lt;/p&gt;
